## 🌟 What is Noodle Nudge?

Noodle Nudge is a **free and open-source** app that works completely offline once you've installed it. It's built with your privacy in mind – **all your data stays right on your device**, never shared or stored anywhere else. Think of it as a quiet, personal journal combined with insightful tools to help you understand yourself better.

## 🧭 Your Journey of Self-Discovery

Noodle Nudge offers a few key areas to help you on your path:

## 🔒 Your Privacy Matters

We believe in user sovereignty and privacy above all else. Noodle Nudge is designed to be a completely private tool. **No data ever leaves your device.** This means you can explore, reflect, and grow with complete peace of mind.

## 🤝 Community

While Noodle Nudge keeps your personal journey private, the spirit of shared wisdom thrives outside the app. You can connect with others, discuss philosophical concepts, or share your general insights (not your personal data!) on forums or websites dedicated to self-improvement and philosophy.

Thank you for choosing Noodle Nudge. We hope it serves as a valuable companion on your journey of self-discovery!
